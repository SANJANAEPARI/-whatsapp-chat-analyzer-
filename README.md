# WHATSAPP-CHAT-ANALYZER

WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a user-friendly web application that allows both tech-savvy and non-technical individuals to effectively analyze their WhatsApp chat data. It provides valuable information such as identifying active participants in the chat, determining the general availability of individuals for conversation based on timestamps, assessing the level of engagement of specific members within a group chat, and identifying the most frequently used words by a particular member.

This versatile analyzer offers various insights and benefits to users. It enables anyone with a WhatsApp account to export their chat data, whether from a group or individual conversation, in a text format without including media files. By uploading this exported chat data to the web application, users can unlock a wealth of valuable information and analytics. It's a powerful tool accessible to all WhatsApp users, regardless of their technical expertise.
